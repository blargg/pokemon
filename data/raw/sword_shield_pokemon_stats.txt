It can be found near the sea. The large pincers grow back if they are torn out of their sockets.

As a bud, it barely moves. It sits still, placidly waiting for sunlight to appear.
Its folded petals are pretty tough. Bird Pok√©mon can peck at them all they want, and Cherrim won‚Äôt be bothered at all.

This Pok√©mon‚Äôs habitat shapes its physique. According to some theories, life in warm ocean waters causes this variation to develop.
Subjecting this Pok√©mon to a strong force causes it to secrete a strange purple fluid. Though harmless, the fluid is awfully sticky.

Its search for food sometimes leads it onto land, where it leaves behind a sticky trail of slime as it passes through.
The softness of its body helps disperse the force of impacts, so although its body is uncommonly squishy, it‚Äôs also surprisingly resilient.

It digs holes in the ground to make its nest. The stench of the fluid it lets fly from the tip of its tail is extremely potent.

It‚Äôs so vicious that it‚Äôs called the Sand Demon. Yet when confronted by Hippowdon, Drapion keeps a low profile and will never pick a fight.

It steals things from people just to amuse itself with their frustration. A rivalry exists between this Pok√©mon and Nickit.
Opponents that get drawn in by its adorable behavior come away with stinging scratches from its claws and stinging pride from its laughter.

It eats dreams and releases mist. The mist is pink when it‚Äôs eating a good dream, and black when it‚Äôs eating a nightmare.

When dark mists emanate from its body, don‚Äôt get too near. If you do, your nightmares will become reality.
It drowses and dreams all the time. It‚Äôs best to leave it be if it‚Äôs just woken up, as it‚Äôs a terrible grump when freshly roused from sleep.

It‚Äôs as hard as steel, but apparently a long soak in water will cause it to soften a bit.
When it detects a noise, it starts to move. The energy core inside it makes this Pok√©mon slightly warm to the touch.

If you see its orange crystals start to glow, be wary. It‚Äôs about to fire off bursts of energy.
It relies on sound in order to monitor what‚Äôs in its vicinity. When angered, it will attack without ever changing the direction it‚Äôs facing.

Its resilient tusks are its pride and joy. It licks up dirt to take in the minerals it needs to keep its tusks in top condition.
While usually kindhearted, it can be terrifying if angered. Tusks that can slice through steel beams are how Haxorus deals with its adversaries.

It throws one knifelike feather after another at its enemies, and each one precisely strikes a weak point. These feathers are known as blade quills.

As if wielding a bow, it launches the arrow quills hidden among the feathers of its wings. Decidueye‚Äôs shots never miss.

Evolves into Dubwool-0 @ 24 (LevelUp) [0]

Its curly fleece is such an effective cushion that this Pok√©mon could fall off a cliff and stand right back up at the bottom, unharmed.
If its fleece grows too long, Wooloo won‚Äôt be able to move. Cloth made with the wool of this Pok√©mon is surprisingly strong.

Its majestic horns are meant only to impress the opposite gender. They never see use in battle.

It‚Äôs so strong that it can knock out some opponents in a single hit, but it also may forget what it‚Äôs battling midfight.
This hungry Pok√©mon swallows Arrokuda whole. Occasionally, it makes a mistake and tries to swallow a Pok√©mon other than its preferred prey.

If it sees any movement around it, this Pok√©mon charges for it straightaway, leading with its sharply pointed jaw. It‚Äôs very proud of that jaw.
After it‚Äôs eaten its fill, its movements become extremely sluggish. That‚Äôs when Cramorant swallows it up.

This Pok√©mon has a jaw that‚Äôs as sharp as a spear and as strong as steel. Apparently Barraskewda‚Äôs flesh is surprisingly tasty, too.
It spins its tail fins to propel itself, surging forward at speeds of over 100 knots before ramming prey and spearing into them.

It stores poison in an internal poison sac and secretes that poison through its skin. If you touch this Pok√©mon, a tingling sensation follows.
It manipulates the chemical makeup of its poison to produce electricity. The voltage is weak, but it can cause a tingling paralysis.

It wraps prey up with its heated body, cooking them in its coils. Once they‚Äôre well-done, it will voraciously nibble them down to the last morsel.

It‚Äôs very curious, but its means of investigating things is to try to punch them with its tentacles. The search for food is what brings it onto land.
Its tentacles tear off easily, but it isn‚Äôt alarmed when that happens‚Äîit knows they‚Äôll grow back. It‚Äôs about as smart as a three-year-old.

In times past, it worked together with a king of the people to save the Galar region. It absorbs metal that it then uses in battle.
This Pok√©mon slept for aeons while in the form of a statue. It was asleep for so long, people forgot that it ever existed.

The core on its chest absorbs energy emanating from the lands of the Galar region. This energy is what allows Eternatus to stay active.
It was inside a meteorite that fell 20,000 years ago. There seems to be a connection between this Pok√©mon and the Dynamax phenomenon.
