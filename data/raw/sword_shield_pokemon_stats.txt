Its elegant and refined behavior clashes with that of the barbaric Perrserker. The relationship between the two is one of mutual disdain.

This Pokémon’s habitat shapes its physique. According to some theories, life in warm ocean waters causes this variation to develop.
Subjecting this Pokémon to a strong force causes it to secrete a strange purple fluid. Though harmless, the fluid is awfully sticky.

Its search for food sometimes leads it onto land, where it leaves behind a sticky trail of slime as it passes through.
The softness of its body helps disperse the force of impacts, so although its body is uncommonly squishy, it’s also surprisingly resilient.

Perhaps seeking company, it approaches children. However, it often quickly runs away again when the children play too roughly with it.
The gathering of many souls gave rise to this Pokémon. During humid seasons, they seem to appear in abundance.

It grabs people and Pokémon and carries them off somewhere. Where do they go? Nobody knows.

If it lifts its tail and points its rear at you, beware. It’s about to spray you with a fluid stinky enough to make you faint.

In its belly, it reserves stinky fluid that it shoots from its tail during battle. As this Pokémon’s diet varies, so does the stench of its fluid.
It digs holes in the ground to make its nest. The stench of the fluid it lets fly from the tip of its tail is extremely potent.

It appears in ancient ruins. The pattern on its body doesn’t come from any culture in the Galar region, so it remains shrouded in mystery.
Polishing Bronzor to a shine makes its surface reflect the truth, according to common lore. Be that as it may, Bronzor hates being polished.

Its poison is potent, but it rarely sees use. This Pokémon prefers to use physical force instead, going on rampages with its car-crushing strength.
It’s so vicious that it’s called the Sand Demon. Yet when confronted by Hippowdon, Drapion keeps a low profile and will never pick a fight.

It steals things from people just to amuse itself with their frustration. A rivalry exists between this Pokémon and Nickit.
Opponents that get drawn in by its adorable behavior come away with stinging scratches from its claws and stinging pride from its laughter.

Late at night, it appears beside people’s pillows. As it feeds on dreams, the patterns on its body give off a faint glow.
It eats dreams and releases mist. The mist is pink when it’s eating a good dream, and black when it’s eating a nightmare.

When dark mists emanate from its body, don’t get too near. If you do, your nightmares will become reality.
It drowses and dreams all the time. It’s best to leave it be if it’s just woken up, as it’s a terrible grump when freshly roused from sleep.

Where people go, these Pokémon follow. If you’re scattering food for them, be careful— several hundred of them can gather at once.
It’s forgetful and not very bright, but many Trainers love it anyway for its friendliness and sincerity.

Evolves into Boldore-0 @ 25 (LevelUp) [0]

It’s as hard as steel, but apparently a long soak in water will cause it to soften a bit.
When it detects a noise, it starts to move. The energy core inside it makes this Pokémon slightly warm to the touch.

Evolves into Gigalith-0 @ 0 (Trade) [0]

If you see its orange crystals start to glow, be wary. It’s about to fire off bursts of energy.
It relies on sound in order to monitor what’s in its vicinity. When angered, it will attack without ever changing the direction it’s facing.

Evolves into Swoobat-0 @ 0 (LevelUpFriendship) [0]

While inside a cave, if you look up and see lots of heart-shaped marks lining the walls, it’s evidence that Woobat live there.
It emits ultrasonic waves as it flutters about, searching for its prey—bug Pokémon.

The auspicious shape of this Pokémon’s nose apparently led some regions to consider Swoobat a symbol of good luck.

It brings its claws together and whirls around at high speed before rushing toward its prey.
It’s a digger, using its claws to burrow through the ground. It causes damage to vegetable crops, so many farmers have little love for it.

Timburr that have started carrying logs that are about three times their size are nearly ready to evolve.

It shows off its muscles to Machoke and other Gurdurr. If it fails to measure up to the other Pokémon, it lies low for a little while.
Gurdurr excels at demolition—construction is not its forte. In any case, there’s skill in the way this Pokémon wields its metal beam.

Concrete mixed by Conkeldurr is much more durable than normal concrete, even when the compositions of the two materials are the same.
When going all out, this Pokémon throws aside its concrete pillars and leaps at opponents to pummel them with its fists.

Graceful ripples running across the water’s surface are a sure sign that Tympole are singing in high-pitched voices below.
It uses sound waves to communicate with others of its kind. People and other Pokémon species can’t hear its cries of warning.

It weakens its prey with sound waves intense enough to cause headaches, then entangles them with its sticky tongue.
On occasion, their cries are sublimely pleasing to the ear. Palpitoad with larger lumps on their bodies can sing with a wider range of sounds.

It shoots cotton from its body to protect itself. If it gets caught up in hurricane-strength winds, it can get sent to the other side of the Earth.
Weaving together the cotton of both Cottonee and Eldegoss produces exquisite cloth that’s highly prized by many luxury brands.

It scatters cotton all over the place as a prank. If it gets wet, it’ll become too heavy to move and have no choice but to answer for its mischief.
As long as this Pokémon bathes in sunlight, its cotton keeps growing. If too much cotton fluff builds up, Whimsicott tears it off and scatters it.

Its body secretes oil that this Pokémon spreads over its nest as a coating to protect it from dust. Cinccino won’t tolerate even a speck of the stuff.
A special oil that seeps through their fur helps them avoid attacks. The oil fetches a high price at market.

After battle, this Pokémon carefully sharpens its tusks on river rocks. It needs to take care of its tusks—if one breaks, it will never grow back.
Its skin is as hard as a suit of armor. Fraxure’s favorite strategy is to tackle its opponents, stabbing them with its tusks at the same time.

Its resilient tusks are its pride and joy. It licks up dirt to take in the minerals it needs to keep its tusks in top condition.
While usually kindhearted, it can be terrifying if angered. Tusks that can slice through steel beams are how Haxorus deals with its adversaries.

It has a strange physiology that responds to electricity. When together with Karrablast, Shelmet evolves for some reason.

It chooses a Pangoro as its master and then imitates its master’s actions. This is how it learns to battle and hunt for prey.
Wanting to make sure it’s taken seriously, Pancham’s always giving others a glare. But if it’s not focusing, it ends up smiling.

Though Espurr’s expression never changes, behind that blank stare is an intense struggle to contain its devastating psychic power.
There’s enough psychic power in Espurr to send a wrestler flying, but because this power can’t be controlled, Espurr finds it troublesome.

Revealing the eyelike patterns on the insides of its ears will unleash its psychic powers. It normally keeps the patterns hidden, however.
The defensive instinct of the males is strong. It’s when they’re protecting themselves or their partners that they unleash their full power.

At a distance, it launches its sharp feathers while flying about. If the enemy gets too close, Rowlet switches tactics and delivers vicious kicks.
During the day, it builds up energy via photosynthesis. At night, it flies silently through the sky, on the prowl for prey.

It throws one knifelike feather after another at its enemies, and each one precisely strikes a weak point. These feathers are known as blade quills.
It never slacks when it comes to the task of cleaning its feathers. Thorough preening keeps it looking spiffy and its blade quills nice and sharp.

As if wielding a bow, it launches the arrow quills hidden among the feathers of its wings. Decidueye’s shots never miss.
In a tenth of a second, it can nock and fire an arrow quill, piercing an opponent’s weak point before they notice what’s happening.

It spends even the smallest amount of downtime grooming its fur with its tongue. Loose fur gathers in its stomach and serves as fuel for fiery moves.
Trying to pet Litten before it trusts you will result in a nasty scratch from its sharp claws. Be careful.

When facing a powerful enemy, Torracat’s fighting spirit gets pumped up, and its fire bell blazes hotter.

It excels at violent, no-holds-barred battles. The temperature of the flames that issue from its navel exceeds 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit.
Incineroar’s rough and aggressive behavior is its most notable trait, but the way it helps out small Pokémon shows that it has a kind side as well.

It uses its big jaws to dig nests into the forest floor, and it loves to feed on sweet tree sap.

While its durable shell protects it from attacks, Charjabug strikes at enemies with jolts of electricity discharged from the tips of its jaws.
Its digestive processes convert the leaves it eats into electricity. An electric sac in its belly stores the electricity for later use.

Nectar and pollen are its favorite fare. You can find Cutiefly hovering around Gossifleur, trying to get some of Gossifleur’s pollen.
An opponent’s aura can tell Cutiefly what that opponent’s next move will be. Then Cutiefly can glide around the attack and strike back.

The first symptom of its sting is numbness. The next is an itching sensation so intense that it’s impossible to resist the urge to claw at your skin.
Unlike their Alolan counterparts, the Mareanie of the Galar region have not yet figured out that the branches of Corsola are delicious.

To survive in the cold waters of Galar, this Pokémon forms a dome with its legs, enclosing its body so it can capture its own body heat.
Within the poison sac in its body is a poison so toxic that Pokémon as large as Wailord will still be suffering three days after it first takes effect.

Once it accepts you as a friend, it tries to show its affection with a hug. Letting it do that is dangerous—it could easily shatter your bones.
The moves it uses to take down its prey would make a martial artist jealous. It tucks subdued prey under its arms to carry them to its nest.

The faster a Thwackey can beat out a rhythm with its two sticks, the more respect it wins from its peers.
When it’s drumming out rapid beats in battle, it gets so caught up in the rhythm that it won’t even notice that it’s already knocked out its opponent.

When it contracts its body, over 220 pounds of sand sprays from its nose. If it ever runs out of sand, it becomes disheartened.

It’s so strong that it can knock out some opponents in a single hit, but it also may forget what it’s battling midfight.
This hungry Pokémon swallows Arrokuda whole. Occasionally, it makes a mistake and tries to swallow a Pokémon other than its preferred prey.

Evolves into Barraskewda-0 @ 26 (LevelUp) [0]

If it sees any movement around it, this Pokémon charges for it straightaway, leading with its sharply pointed jaw. It’s very proud of that jaw.
After it’s eaten its fill, its movements become extremely sluggish. That’s when Cramorant swallows it up.

This Pokémon has a jaw that’s as sharp as a spear and as strong as steel. Apparently Barraskewda’s flesh is surprisingly tasty, too.
It spins its tail fins to propel itself, surging forward at speeds of over 100 knots before ramming prey and spearing into them.

It stores poison in an internal poison sac and secretes that poison through its skin. If you touch this Pokémon, a tingling sensation follows.
It manipulates the chemical makeup of its poison to produce electricity. The voltage is weak, but it can cause a tingling paralysis.

It stores flammable gas in its body and uses it to generate heat. The yellow sections on its belly get particularly hot.
It wraps prey up with its heated body, cooking them in its coils. Once they’re well-done, it will voraciously nibble them down to the last morsel.

Evolves into Grapploct-0 @ 0 (LevelUpKnowMove) [269]

It’s very curious, but its means of investigating things is to try to punch them with its tentacles. The search for food is what brings it onto land.
Its tentacles tear off easily, but it isn’t alarmed when that happens—it knows they’ll grow back. It’s about as smart as a three-year-old.

In ancient times, it was unbeatable thanks to its powerful lower body, but it went extinct anyway after it depleted all its plant-based food sources.
The powerful muscles in its tail generate its electricity. Compared to its lower body, its upper half is entirely too small.

This Pokémon lived on prehistoric seashores and was able to preserve food with the ice on its body. It went extinct because it moved so slowly.

The special metal that composes its body is very light, so this Pokémon has considerable agility. It lives in caves because it dislikes the rain.

If this weak Pokémon is by itself, a mere child could defeat it. But if Dreepy has friends to help it train, it can evolve and become much stronger.

It’s capable of flying faster than 120 mph. It battles alongside Dreepy and dotes on them until they successfully evolve.
Without a Dreepy to place on its head and care for, it gets so uneasy it’ll try to substitute any Pokémon it finds for the missing Dreepy.

Apparently the Dreepy inside Dragapult’s horns eagerly look forward to being launched out at Mach speeds.

In times past, it worked together with a king of the people to save the Galar region. It absorbs metal that it then uses in battle.
This Pokémon slept for aeons while in the form of a statue. It was asleep for so long, people forgot that it ever existed.

The core on its chest absorbs energy emanating from the lands of the Galar region. This energy is what allows Eternatus to stay active.
It was inside a meteorite that fell 20,000 years ago. There seems to be a connection between this Pokémon and the Dynamax phenomenon.
